In order to ensure quality, the the Reliable User Datagram Protocol (RUDP) extends UDP by means of adding the following features:

- Acknowledgment of received packets
- Windowing and flow control
- Retransmission of lost packets
- TCP-like handshakes

All of these features are added using the application layer payload for the UDP protocol.
