Along the Autostrada Soarelui, $n$ beautiful villas were built, numbered in order with numbers from $1$ to $n$. In each villa lives a solarium. The administration has come to the conclusion that the solarians get along better with each other the closer they are, so it is interested in finding out the maximum age difference between any two neighbors.

###Task

Knowing the age of each solarium, find out the maximum age difference between two neighbors. By neighbors the solariums mean two inhabitants for whom the modulus of the difference between the numbers of their villas does not exceed the number $k$.

###Input

On the first line of the input file vila2.in are written the numbers $n$ and $k$, separated by a single space. On the next $n$ lines are $n$ integers, representing, in order, the ages of the solariums.

###Output

The first line of file vila2.out will contain the maximum difference found.

###Constraints

$2$ $≤$ $n$ $≤$ $100$ $000$
$1$ $≤$ $k$ $≤$ $n/2$
A solarium lives at most $30$ $000$ years
