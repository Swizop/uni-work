Consider a string AA with NN integers. For each subsequent sequence of length KK to determine the minimum, and then to calculate the sum of these minimums.

Task
It must display the required amount.

Input
On the first line of file deque.in are the numbers NN and KK with the meaning of the statement. On the next NN lines there is an integer from the given series.

Output
In output file deque.out there will be a single integer representing the required amount.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 5 000 0001≤N≤5000000
1 ≤ K ≤ N1≤K≤N
The elements in the string will have values between -10 000 000−10000000 and 10 000 00010000000
For the result it is recommended to use integer types on 6464 bits
